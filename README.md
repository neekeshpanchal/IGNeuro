# IGNeuro: Neuron Firing Pattern Analyzer

## Overview

**IGNeuro** is a graphical user interface (GUI) tool designed to analyze and visualize neuron firing patterns using various information geometry and machine learning techniques. The primary purpose of this project is to apply these advanced techniques to arbitrary datasets of neuron firing patterns, enabling users to practice and explore their applications in computational neuroscience.

The tool provides several key analyses:
1. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**
2. **t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)**
3. **Autoencoder Visualization**
4. **Joint Probabilities Calculation**
5. **Fisher Information**
6. **Geodesic Analysis**

## Interface

**t-SNE, PCA, Autoencoder, applied towards capturing relationships between a 12-n cell assembly**
